# Defcon26Badge

This is a custom badge for our friend group. At its core, it's an Atmel ATMEGA328P running the arduino bootloader. 

Peripherals:

-5x10 RGB Neopixel array

-LIS3DH Triple Axis Accelerometer

-NRF24L01 2.4GHz wireless transciever

-Piezo Buzzer

-6 Tact Switches

-3 Status Lights

-UART Debugging Port


The chip is soldered to the board, so it's programmed using an Arduino as an ISP. This also enables easy access to UART.
